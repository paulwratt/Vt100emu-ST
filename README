The Program (VT100EMU.PRG) can be installed in the AUTO folder and then installs
the replacement VT100 emulation in the system. 

The little program MINITERM.PRG allows to use it as a terminal program together
with a modem.


vt100/vt52-emulator, which replaces the internal vt52
             with IBM-, Atari- and Grafic-charset
             runs also with kaq9 and nos

System: ST/Mega-ST with <=TOS1.04 in ST-High (KAOS also)
        other config not yet tested

I have now decided to publish the source code for VT100EMU-ST with 
GPLv2. It was not the first, but surely the best vt100/vt52 emulation in 
replacement for the internal VT52 of the ATARI ST: 

The original licence was: shareware. The original readme (in german) 
is the file vt100emu.txt.

Trivia: I have used the code and the graphics extension also in TTconsole for
TomTom navigation devices in 2008.
