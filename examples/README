All .ANS files can be displayed with the VT100 terminal emulation by 
just double clicking on them (on the ATARI ST) after the emulation 
has been installed.

They demontrate some of the features of the emulation.

READ_ME.ANS   -- a nicer readme
DRUCK.ANS     -- demonstrate the printing capabilities
